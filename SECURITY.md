## Supported Versions

At the moment this project is in beta. *This project is not production ready*. Therefore we currently don't support any particuar version except `master` and the current [pypi release](https://pypi.org/project/pentagraph/).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you find a vulnerability, open an issue and add [Vulnerability] to the title. These issues will be handled asap. Please also consider if the vulnerability might lay in a dependency rather than in the project. If this is the case report this to them as soons as possible. You should also open an issue here, so that we can try to create a workaround.
