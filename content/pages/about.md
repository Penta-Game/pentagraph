Summary: About us section for pentagraph

The pentagraph library was created to make development with pentagame easy for beginners while maintains functionality for advanced users. It's based on [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) but also takes advantage of [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (experimental) for a graphical interface in the browser.
